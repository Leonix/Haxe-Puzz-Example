Haxe-Puzz-Example
=================

Author: Victor Grunn / Joseph Antolick

A custom, if stripped down, version of Bejeweled. The basics are
represented here - the initial generated level has no automatic
matches (No 3 in a row generated initially, etc). Pressing 'F'
between turns locates all possible matches on the board, reducing
the alpha of all relevant blocks by one half.

Features recursive solution checking, dynamic tweening, convenient
use of enums and object oriented principles.

Made with the HaxeFlixel library, almost exclusively for graphical
representation.

export/flash/bin contains a runnable .swf. This was the code base
for the Complexity project also viewable in my repositories.
